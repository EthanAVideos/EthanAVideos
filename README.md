- 📜 When I first started modding, I played around with mod XMLs for Farming Simulator 2011. As time passed, I began to tinker with mod files for Farming Simulator 17. Then, about three years ago, I started creating my own mods for Farming Simulator 19. At first, I mostly edited existing mods, but gradually I started making my own from scratch. Nowadays, I focus on creating my own mods for Farming Simulator 22 and I don't usually edit or release other people's mods. And that's the story of my modding journey!
